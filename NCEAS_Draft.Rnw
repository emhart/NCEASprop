{\bf Project Summary:} Species range shifts is one of the most well documented responses of species to climate change and have been modeled using correlative niche models (species distribution models, SDMs) for more than a decade.  These models are stastical correlations between a species realized niche and abiotic variables, because they ignore ecological theory there is often a difference between predictions and a species' actual distribution (error). One potential source of error is that these models ignore differing rates of adaptation to novel climates.  Our group will seek to understand the source of this error using meta-analysis, and integrate adaptation into range shift theory. However much of the data from these models is locked in the form of published figures and maps. Therefore a second outcome of our working group will be a web-based data extraction tool. This will allow anyone to upload a figure and extract data from it and store it in DataONE.  Beyond producing manuscripts, we will contribute tools for meta-analysis beyond the life of our working group.

\section*{Problem Statement}
Species' range shifts was one of the earliest documented ecological responses to climate change \citep{Parmesan1996,Parmesan1999,Parmesan2003}.  Understanding rang shifts is a pressing issue because as warming increases, species are exhibiting rapid distributional changes \citep{Chen2011}. Since the late 1990's ecologist's have been using species' distribution models (SDM's) to try and predict how those ranges will shift over the next century \citep{Davis1998,Iverson1998,Guisan2000,Peterson2001}. These models assume that the realized niche of a species is primarily determined by climate variables \citep{Austin2002,Dormann2007}.   Early models ignored physiology,  biotic interactions and rapid local adaptation, relying soley on correlations between current distribution and climate variables \citep{Davis1998,Pearson2003,Guisan2005,Helmuth2005}.  Aside from variance due to lack of ecological theory \citep{Elith2009}, SDM's can show great variance in their predictive abilities \citep{Elith2006,Kearney2009,Elith2010}.  More recent SDM's have begun to incorporate mechanisms such as physiology \citep{Crozier2006,Buckley2010,Buckley2011} and  life history traits \citep{Midgley2006,Kearney2009,Poyry2009,Angert2011a} to improve fit. Including traits and physiology offers a significant improvement in model predictions \citep{Angert2011a,Buckley2011} but still only explain small percentage of variance.  Other factors may be important in explaining the error in species actual ranges and their predicted distribution such as biotic interaction and adaptation. \\

\end{wrapfigure}
Adaptation is important to understanding how species will respond to climate change \citep{Visser2008,lavergne2010biodiversity,Hoffmann2011}, but is difficult to accurately measure in the field \citep{Hansen2012}.  Here we define adaptation as evolution of traits that increase fitness in novel environments \citep{Reznick2001}, as opposed to phenotypically plastic adaptations that will not allow species to persist in the long term \citep{Hoffmann2011}.
Despite adaptation playing an important role in species range shifts to both current \citep{Thomas2001,Bridle2007} and historical climate change \citep{Davis2001} it is conspicuously absent from SDMs \citep{Hoffman2011} (but see \citet{Kearney2009a}).  
Shorter generation times allow for a more rapid adaptive response to strong selective pressures \citep{Berteaux2004,Somero2010,Hoffmann2011,Reed2011,Shaw2012,Walters2012}.  The first reason is that species with shorter generation times can make use of standing additive genetic variation (Figure 1). Models of population persistence have demonstrated that shorter generation times can allow populations to persist by novel adaptation \citep{Gomulkiewicz1995, Hoffmann2011}. For instance fur seals are predicted to be unable to adapt to rapid climate change because of long generation times, but this is not the case for other antartic species with short generation times \citep{Forcada2008}. One consequence of strong directional selection is the loss of additive genenetic variance necessary for adaptation \citep{Lande1996,Hoffmann2011}.  However, species with shorter generation times also have higher rates of molecular evolution due to increased mutation rates \citep{Thomas2010} adding to the total additive genetic variance.  The expecation is species with short generation times will track their climate on the expanding front of the range, but not necessarily go extinct at the trailing edge, instead adapting to novel climate conditions. Therefore one of the fundamental assumptions of SDMs, that species will track their current climate conditions as they shift latitudinally, can be violated by species with short generation times. \\

\textbf{Our goal is to (1) quantify SDM error across a range of taxa, (2) investigate how rates of adaptation introduce error model prediction, and  (3) build tools to automatically extract data from figures in the published literature.}
\section*{Proposed Activities}

Despite more than a decade of publications on SDM's, adaptation is still absent from most models \citep{Kearney2009}. We want to analyze the large number of existing SDMs and attempt to integrate adaptation into range shift theory. By calculating a standard metric of error it is possible to construct models of that unexplained deviance from actual distributions.  The challenge is that much of the data for these models is locked in the form of published figures.  Methods already exist for data extraction such as the \textit{digitize} package \citep{Poisot2011} for R (Figure 2).

\end{figure}
Using a combination of JavaScript and Python, we want to implement a web based interface for the extraction of data from a variety of figuret types in existing publications.
Furthermore once we collect data on error rates in SDM prediction we can test other hypotheses such as the influence of biotic interacitons or the breakdown of mutualistic networks.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Quantify the amount of error in published SDMs by comparing model predictions to original data sources.}
        
        \begin{itemize}
        \item By returning to the original data sources, we can measure the error rate of predicted distributions and actual distributions.  We will store this in a publicly accessibl database on DataONE.
        \end{itemize}
   \item \textit{Investigate the sources of error in SDMs, testing hypotheses about how rates of adaptation contribute to error. }
        \begin{itemize}
        \item We hypothesize that SDMs for species with shorter generation times should have greater error rates because they can rapidly adapt to new invaders and novel climate scenarios at the trailing edge of their distribution (Figure 3).  Therefore they are less likely to track their current shifting climate.  We will test this hypothesis by constructing mixed-effects models of SDM error.
        \end{itemize}
     
    
    \item \textit{Develop a web-based interface for data extraction from digitized figures.}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item We will develop an open source tool that allows anyone to extract data from digital figures including: scatter plots, bar charts and georeferencable maps.  The interface will store the data at DataONE which can then be used for any future meta-analysis.
        \end{itemize}

\textit{Error analysis} \\
Error can be calculated in three ways: difference in area of occupancy, difference in expanding front, and difference in trailing edge.  The first two are the most common and we will have the largest sample from these.  Because the trailing edge is of the most interest, it can be inferred from total area of occupancy.  Species with less shift in the trailing edge will have a larger total area of occupancy.  All these can be theoretically be compared by converting them to Z-scores and calculating a standard error statistic such as root-mean squared error.  Once we have quantified error, we can construct mixed-effects models with error as the response variable. Using this framework we can add other covariates into our models to control for modeling artifacts, for instance it's known that different SDM contstruction methods have differences in performance \citep{Elith2006, Elith2010}.  Furthermore we will have assembled a database of residual model error.  Our primary goal will be to analyze error in terms of generation time, but this does not exclude considering biotic interactions.  Our group has two experts in networks: mutualistic networks (Chamberlain) and food webs (Poisot, Hart).  Therefore we will also consider mutualistic pairs of species and examine if range shifts are limited by lack co-expanding mutualists \citep(Hellmann2008, Pelini2010) or enhanced by freedom from competitive interactions \citep{Hellmann2012}.\\

\section*{Anticipated Results and Benefits}
Accurate prediction of species range shifts is of theoretical and conseravtion importance \citep{Thomas2006}, and can have important economic implications (such as pest management \citep{Thomson2010}).  Integrating adaptation into range shift theory also has direct conservation value because it can be used in efforts to save biodiverisity \citep{Heller2009,Sgro2011}.  By examining what factors impact SDM prediction error, we can identify what factors are of greatest importance in future SDM models, and perhaps which factors are less relevant for immediate impelmentation.  We will produce manuscripts and tools that will be of broad interest to other researchers and consrevation managers.  We expect a minimum of 3 publications and 1 software tool and potentially other papers.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A review paper of the existing SDMs and their error rates.
        (\textit{Goal 1}, Target journals: Review in Global change biology, Concepts and Synthesis in Ecology)
  \item Meta-analysis of SDM error and generation time exploring down rates of adaptation influence the predictablity of range shifts. (\textit{Goal 2} Target high impact journals: Science, Nature, Ecology Letters, PNAS )
  
  \item A methods paper detailing the algorithms and procedures used to automattically extract data from figures (\textit{Goal 3} Targe journals: Methods in Ecology and Evolution,PLoS ONE, Ecological Informatics)
  
  \item A software tool that will be a website where people can extract figure data from any paper they want.  We will work closely with the NCEAS KNB staff on how best to manage and store data at KNB and DataONE.  This tool with have lasting usefulness for meta-analysis well past the lifespan of our working group.
  
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Rational to conduct work at NCEAS}
NCEAS is an ideal place to conduct our work because it is the perfect place to combine deep ecological knowledge and computational expertise in data management.  The KNB and the expertise of NCEAS computational staff will be important to successfully managing the data we hope to collect, as well as their collaborating with software engineers in developing our figure extraction tool.  Several of our particpants (Buckley and Angert) were members of an earlier working group (NCEAS Project 12054: Mechanistic distribution models: Energetics, fitness, and population dynamics) which improved species distirbution models by including traits and physiology.  This project builds off that initial worknig group by trying integrating adaptation into SDM theory.\\
